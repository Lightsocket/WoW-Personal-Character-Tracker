# WoW-Personal-Character-Tracker
A simple console app to track your characters in WoW. WIP
This program will ask you simple questions about your character to get them added to the database. You will then be able to pull any existing character and add
various types of information that are hard to track across multiple toons. Such as:
Dungeons/raid bosses completed on the toon (Currently will only support patch 9.2),
When you enter that you have completed a set amount of content (1 Mythic+ dungeon, 2 raid boss kills, or earned 1250 honor) when pulling toons on Tuesday's it will 
display if that toon will have a vault loot that week. 
Once a class is selected with a toon this console app will also display a link to that classes respective Icy-Veins guide. 
All character screens will contain a direct link to raidbots for character simming.
More to come soon. Keep watch here for when this is completed.
