# WoW-Personal-Character-Tracker
A simple console app to track your characters in WoW. WIP
The purpose of this app currently is to keep track of all of your World of Warcraft character's progress in a given week. In its current state, it is keeping track of three of my personal wow characters. When clicking "E" for existing at the start, it will populate a list of the added character's. Depending on the character selected, it will pull that character's information up. I'm in the process of adding a feature to say "All" and have the system populate all characters who will have a vault in that week. 
Current known issues:
Not yet added the ability to edit this list outside of the code, this will be coming within the next day max.
Not yet added the ability to add new toons, this will be added within the next few hours.
The application is exiting automatically at the end of dialogue instead of when user inputs "exit". Fixing this by end of day tomorrow. 03/30/2022.
In test cases, the app is pulling names correctly (the current pushed code will only pull character "Lightsocket" this has been fixed and will be included in future updates. This is merely a push to show what the app will do. 


*** Intended feature list ***
Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event(found in lines 130-137)

Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program'(Lines 75-159)

Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program(lines 52-72)


Future goal 
--- 6 months time --- 
Take this application and turn it into a desktop application or website where this information can be stored and pulled at will by individuals with created accounts.
--- 3 years time ---
This is a long way to look forward, but within three years time I would like to implement this as an addon in CurseForge to be utilized and updated directly by the game. Thus allowing it to send you push notifications on your Desktop, Website, or IN GAME to remind you of things you may need to do on alts that week. Only beginning with a list of which toons you still haven't checked who potentitally have upgrades waiting in their vaults (formally known as weekly-chest).
